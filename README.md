# A quick vcf to ics exporter, converter, whatever...

It exports all vCard contacts with a birthday into a vCalender
with yearly events.

You might need to change the `index.ts` file if your username isn't christoph
and your contacts dump isn't saved in ~/Downloads/contacts.vcf.

```
npm install
npm start
```
